# Step 3: Understand Networking Basics

## Beginner

1. **Configure network interfaces using the command line**
   - Use `ip` command to view network interfaces
   - Manually assign an IP address using `ip addr add`
   - Set up a static IP by editing the appropriate configuration file (e.g., `/etc/network/interfaces` on Debian-based systems)

2. **Use basic networking tools**
   - Use `ping` to check connectivity to various hosts
   - Use `traceroute` to examine the path to a remote host
   - Use `nslookup` and `dig` to query DNS information

3. **Set up a simple firewall using iptables**
   - List current iptables rules
   - Add a rule to allow incoming SSH connections
   - Add a rule to block a specific IP address
   - Save the rules so they persist after reboot

## Intermediate

1. **Configure a DHCP server**
   - Install and configure `isc-dhcp-server`
   - Define a DHCP scope with IP range, subnet mask, and lease time
   - Configure DHCP options like default gateway and DNS servers
   - Test by connecting a client machine

2. **Set up a local DNS server using BIND**
   - Install BIND9
   - Configure BIND for caching DNS queries
   - Set up a local zone file for your network
   - Test using `dig` and by configuring a client to use your DNS server

3. **Implement network address translation (NAT)**
   - Configure your Linux machine as a router
   - Set up iptables rules to perform NAT
   - Test by connecting a client machine and verifying internet access

## Advanced

1. **Configure a VPN server using OpenVPN**
   - Install OpenVPN
   - Generate necessary certificates and keys
   - Configure the OpenVPN server
   - Set up client configurations
   - Test the VPN connection from a remote machine

2. **Implement network monitoring using Nagios or Zabbix**
   - Install and configure your chosen monitoring system
   - Add multiple hosts and services to monitor
   - Set up alerts for various scenarios (e.g., high CPU usage, disk space running low)
   - Create custom checks for specific applications

3. **Set up a load balancer using HAProxy**
   - Install HAProxy
   - Configure HAProxy to distribute traffic between multiple web servers
   - Implement health checks
   - Test the load balancing by simulating traffic and monitoring server loads
