# Step 8: Master Disk Management

## Beginner

1. **Partition a disk and create filesystems using `fdisk` and `mkfs`**
   - Use `fdisk` to create partitions on a new disk
   - Format the partitions with appropriate filesystems (e.g., ext4 or xfs) using `mkfs`
   - Mount the partitions and update `/etc/fstab` for persistence

2. **Set up a simple RAID 1 array using `mdadm`**
   - Use `mdadm` to create a RAID 1 array with two disks
   - Monitor the RAID array status using `cat /proc/mdstat`
   - Test the RAID setup by removing and re-adding a disk

3. **Create and manage LVM volumes**
   - Create a physical volume, volume group, and logical volumes using LVM tools (`pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, `lvcreate`)
   - Format and mount the logical volumes
   - Extend or reduce the size of the logical volumes as needed

## Intermediate

1. **Implement a RAID 5 or RAID 10 setup**
   - Use `mdadm` to configure a RAID 5 or RAID 10 array
   - Monitor the array for disk failures and simulate a disk failure for testing
   - Rebuild the array and verify data integrity

2. **Use LVM to create snapshots and perform system backups**
   - Create an LVM snapshot of a logical volume
   - Use the snapshot to back up the volume using `rsync` or `tar`
   - Test restoring from the snapshot

3. **Set up disk encryption using LUKS**
   - Use `cryptsetup` to encrypt a disk or partition with LUKS
   - Mount the encrypted disk and ensure it's accessible only after entering the passphrase
   - Automate the decryption process at boot time (if appropriate)

## Advanced

1. **Implement a software-defined storage solution using Ceph**
   - Install and configure Ceph on multiple nodes
   - Set up Ceph storage pools and monitor cluster health
   - Test high availability and scalability by adding or removing nodes

2. **Develop a script for automated storage provisioning and management**
   - Write a script that:
     - Automatically detects new disks
     - Configures them with LVM or RAID
     - Mounts the storage and updates configuration files

3. **Set up a high-availability storage cluster with automatic failover**
   - Use DRBD or GlusterFS to create a high-availability storage cluster
   - Configure automatic failover between nodes
   - Test failover by simulating a node failure
