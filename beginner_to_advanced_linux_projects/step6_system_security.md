# Step 6: Understand System Security

## Beginner

1. **Configure basic firewall rules using `ufw` or `firewalld`**
   - Use `ufw` or `firewalld` to:
     - Allow traffic on specific ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP)
     - Block incoming traffic from specific IP addresses
     - Verify firewall status and rules

2. **Set up SSH key-based authentication**
   - Generate an SSH key pair using `ssh-keygen`
   - Copy the public key to a remote server using `ssh-copy-id`
   - Disable password-based login for SSH on the remote server

3. **Implement basic SELinux policies**
   - Check the current SELinux status using `sestatus`
   - Enable SELinux in enforcing mode if disabled
   - Apply simple policies for user home directories and web services

## Intermediate

1. **Configure and use `fail2ban` to protect against brute-force attacks**
   - Install `fail2ban`
   - Configure it to monitor SSH logs for failed login attempts
   - Set up banning rules based on a number of failed attempts
   - Test the configuration by simulating multiple failed logins

2. **Implement two-factor authentication for SSH**
   - Install `libpam-google-authenticator`
   - Configure SSH to require two-factor authentication (TOTP)
   - Set up Google Authenticator on your phone and test login with 2FA

3. **Set up and configure an intrusion detection system (IDS) like Snort**
   - Install Snort or Suricata
   - Configure basic rules to detect common network threats
   - Set up alerts and monitor logs for detected intrusions

## Advanced

1. **Implement a comprehensive SELinux policy for a multi-service environment**
   - Write and apply custom SELinux policies for web servers, databases, and application services
   - Use `audit2allow` to troubleshoot and resolve denied access
   - Test the policies under various load scenarios

2. **Set up a centralized logging and SIEM system**
   - Install and configure a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack or Graylog)
   - Set up agents on various servers to forward logs to the central system
   - Implement correlation rules to detect potential security incidents

3. **Conduct and automate regular security audits using tools like Lynis**
   - Install Lynis or OpenVAS
   - Run security scans across your infrastructure
   - Automate regular audits and generate reports on system vulnerabilities
