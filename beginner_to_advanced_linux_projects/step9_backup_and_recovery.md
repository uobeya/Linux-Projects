# Step 9: Understand Backup and Recovery

## Beginner

1. **Create a simple backup script using `rsync`**
   - Write a script that:
     - Uses `rsync` to copy files from a source directory to a backup location
     - Preserves file permissions and timestamps
     - Runs daily using `cron`

2. **Use `tar` to create compressed backups**
   - Create a script that:
     - Uses `tar` to compress a directory into a `.tar.gz` file
     - Verifies the integrity of the archive
     - Stores the archive in a backup location

3. **Implement a basic backup rotation scheme**
   - Write a script that:
     - Maintains daily, weekly, and monthly backups
     - Deletes old backups beyond a certain threshold (e.g., keeping the last 7 daily backups)

## Intermediate

1. **Set up an incremental backup system using `rsnapshot`**
   - Install and configure `rsnapshot` for incremental backups
   - Set up daily, weekly, and monthly backup schedules
   - Test restoring files from an incremental backup

2. **Implement off-site backups using `rclone` with cloud storage**
   - Install `rclone` and configure it to sync backups to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive)
   - Automate the sync process using a cron job
   - Verify the integrity of the backups in the cloud

3. **Create a disaster recovery plan and test restore procedures**
   - Document a disaster recovery plan that includes backup and restore procedures
   - Simulate a disaster scenario by wiping a system and restoring from backups
   - Verify the restored system's functionality

## Advanced

1. **Implement a multi-site backup solution with deduplication**
   - Set up a backup system that stores data in multiple locations (on-premises and cloud)
   - Use deduplication tools like `borg` or `restic` to minimize backup size
   - Automate backup replication across sites

2. **Develop a backup system that integrates with containerized applications**
   - Write a script that:
     - Detects running Docker containers
     - Backs up container data and configuration
     - Ensures container-specific files (e.g., volumes) are backed up correctly

3. **Create an automated backup verification and testing system**
   - Write a system that:
     - Automatically verifies the integrity of backups (e.g., comparing checksums)
     - Tests the restore process by spinning up a test environment
     - Reports on backup health and restore success
