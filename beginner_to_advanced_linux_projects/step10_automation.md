# Step 10: Learn Automation

## Beginner

1. **Automate daily system maintenance tasks using Bash**
   - Write a script that automates tasks like clearing logs, updating the system, and cleaning up temporary files
   - Schedule the script to run daily using `cron`

2. **Create a simple Ansible playbook for software installation**
   - Install Ansible
   - Write a playbook that installs a list of packages on a remote server
   - Test the playbook by running it on a test server

3. **Use `cron` to schedule automated tasks**
   - Write and schedule at least 3 tasks using `cron` (e.g., system backups, disk space monitoring)
   - Verify task execution by checking log files or system behavior

## Intermediate

1. **Develop Ansible roles for complete system configuration**
   - Organize Ansible playbooks into roles for easier management
   - Create roles for services like Apache, MySQL, and system hardening
   - Apply these roles to multiple servers in your environment

2. **Implement GitOps practices for infrastructure management**
   - Use Git to version control infrastructure configuration (e.g., Ansible playbooks, Terraform files)
   - Set up automated deployment of infrastructure changes when commits are pushed to a Git repository

3. **Create a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI**
   - Install and configure Jenkins or GitLab CI
   - Set up a pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys a simple application
   - Automate the deployment process using Ansible or a similar tool

## Advanced

1. **Implement infrastructure as code using Terraform and Ansible**
   - Write Terraform configurations to provision cloud infrastructure
   - Use Ansible to configure the infrastructure after provisioning
   - Automate the entire process with a CI/CD pipeline

2. **Develop a self-healing system using Ansible and custom scripts**
   - Write scripts that monitor system health (e.g., checking services or resources)
   - Use Ansible to automatically restart services or re-provision resources when issues are detected

3. **Create a fully automated environment provisioning system**
   - Use Terraform, Ansible, and cloud APIs to provision and configure entire environments
   - Automate everything from server creation to software deployment
   - Implement environment scaling and teardown as needed
